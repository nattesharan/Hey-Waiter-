A waiter caller web application that allows restaurant patrons to easily call a waiter to their table.

We will dive even deeper into the Flask world, taking a look at some Flask extensions
to help us with user account control and web forms, and we'll look at how to use
template inheritance in Jinja, too. We'll also use the Bootstrap frontend framework so
that we don't have to do so much of the HTML and CSS code from scratch.We will be using MongoDB as our database.
